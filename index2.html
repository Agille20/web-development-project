            <!--Paragraph 1 details my background which will be updated as I figure out a better way to portray it.-->
            <p>
                An interesting fact about my background is that I come from a family of arborists.
                I also have a background in engineering as I have already completed an Associates program in Engineering Technology.
                I enjoy the outdoors and have traveled throughout the South to conduct my arborist work.
                I have am pursing my Bachelors in Cybersecurity and hope to learn a lot from the professors at KSU.

            <p>
                My experiences in life consist of a variety of differnt things.
                I am a part of the Army Reserves and have experience with the military.
                I am working to become a certified arborist as well.
                I also have experience travelling as I have travelled throughout the South to aid with storm cleanup efforts which as of late has been extensive.

            <!--Paragraph 3 details some goals I have set in place to keep myself busy and on track.-->
            <p>
                Goals that I have set for myself include ranking up in the military, acheiving my Bachelors in Cybersecurity, and becoming a certified arborist by taking the ISA.
                These goals are ambitious and will be time consuming but will help to better me.
                I have set a timeline for these goals to be comleted within 5 years.
                While these could be considered short-term goals I do have certain long-term goals as well.
                I hope to own a house one day and travel the world, which may sound like everyone else but I see them as long-term goals and activites.
